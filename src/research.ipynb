Установка распределяющих дисков TS 20 или TS 30.\\n2. Включение системы ArgusTwin, так как WindControl работает только в сочетании с этой системой.\\n3. Использование гидравлического привода разбрасывающих дисков.\\n4. Проверка правильности ввода параметра дальности разбрасывания перед использованием WindControl.\\n\\nКогда начинают вращаться распределяющие диски, датчик ветра автоматически поднимается в рабочее положение. При остановке дисков датчик опускается в транспортное положение. Скорость движения машины должна быть больше 3 км/ч для складывания датчика ветра.\\n\\nСистема WindControl предоставляет индикацию скорости и направления ветра, а также работает в автоматическом режиме, компенсируя влияние ветра. Характеристики ветра отображаются с цветовой индикацией: зеленый цвет указывает на возможность компенсации влияния ветра, желтый — на частичную компенсацию, красный — на достижение пределов настройки, при которых рекомендуется прервать работу, а серый — на невозможность работы WindControl при частоте вращения разбрасывающих дисков меньше 500 об/мин.\\n\\nТакже в настройках WindControl можно выбрать единицу измерения силы ветра (м/с или шкала Бофорта) и активировать функцию распознавания порывов ветра.\\n\\nДля обеспечения безопасности и эффективности работы, важно следить за габаритной высотой машины, которая не должна превышать 4 м, и убедиться, что датчик ветра находится на 500 мм выше самой высокой точки машины и трактора.\\n\\nИспользование WindControl позволяет значительно улучшить оптимизацию поперечного распределения, повысить урожайность и обеспечить эксплуатационную безопасность за счет автоматической системы оповещения.'}\n",

Вот основные моменты, которые следует учитывать:\\n\\n1. **Настройка GPS-приемника**:\\n   - Если трактор отправляет сигнал GPS в виде NMEA2000 на шину ISOBUS, то AmaTron 4 может использовать этот сигнал GPS. В этом случае необходимо в меню настроек выбрать \"GPS\" и в разделе \"Вход GPS-приемника\" выбрать \"ISOBUS NMEA2000\".\\n   - Если используется другой GPS-приемник, который подключен к NMEA0183, то в меню настроек также выбираем \"GPS\" и в разделе \"Вход GPS-приемника\" выбираем \"GPS (NMEA0183)\". Важно убедиться, что скорость передачи данных соответствует требованиям GPS-приемника (не менее 19200 бод или оптимально 57600 бод).\\n   - В случае необходимости можно сбросить GPS-приемник до заводских настроек.\\n\\n2. **Использование функции Section Control/GPS-Switch**:\\n   - Если на терминале есть функция Section Control, то включение секций может происходить автоматически в зависимости от GPS-положения.\\n   - GPS-Switch basic позволяет автоматическое посекционное включение до 16 секций, а GPS-Switch pro - до 128 секций для распределителей с гидравлическим приводом распределительных дисков.\\n   - Функция SwitchPoint позволяет настроить точки включения и выключения в зависимости от сорта удобрений и ширины захвата.\\n\\n3. **Настройка отображения карты**:\\n   - В рабочем меню необходимо активировать или деактивировать \"Автомасштабирование\" и настроить расстояние срабатывания автомасштабирования.\\n   - При необходимости можно настроить уровни масштабирования карты.\\n\\n4. **Убедитесь, что доступна лицензия для \"GPS-Switch pro\"**:\\n   - Это важно для использования всех возможностей автоматического посекционного включения.\\n\\nСледуя этим инструкциям, вы сможете настроить GPS Switch для нормальной работы.
